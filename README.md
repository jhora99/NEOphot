# NEOphot
This repository contains the jupyter notebook NEOphot which was used to reduce the Spitzer Space Telescope dataset of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) observed during the Spitzer warm mission in several survey programs. Mosaic photometry and lightcurves are extracted from the series of images obtained on each object and stored in csv files.

Details are provided in Hora et al. 2025 (submitted).
