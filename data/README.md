# Data files

These are the "machine-readable tables" or MRT files from the publication.

Also here is a tar file of all of the individual photometric measurements that were produced by the NEOphot pipeline to prepare for the paper. For objects with many data points over long times, periods were derived and presented in the paper and these tables. 

For all objects, the flux was measured from the mosaics created from all valid images, and the values are reported in Table 2 (ajadbf99t2_mrt.txt).
